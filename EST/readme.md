These are notes and code inspired by the book: "Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)", edited by J. Parkinson, 2009, Humana Press and springer.com. 

ESTs are single-pass  short (usually <1000 bp) reads, derived fron cDNA clones; it is a highly cost-effective way to discover genes. It is valuable for genome annotation and as an alternative to microarray analysis, for finding relative levels of gene expression. NGS (in 2009) made it cost-effective for small labs also to undertake EST. 

Ch. 1: EST Overview: ESTs are fragments of mRNA sequences (often overlapping) that are expressed via combination with randomly selected clones from cDNA libraries. They represent expressed portion of a genome, from either a whole organism or specific tissues - hence very useful for novel gene discovery and verification of gene predictions. As of 2013 (not sure why no update since then), there were 74,186,692 entries in dbEST, of which 8,704,790 were human entries. dbEST accepts only single-pass reads, not assembled sequences.
